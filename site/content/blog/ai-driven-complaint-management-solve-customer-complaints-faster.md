## Implementing an AI-Driven Complaint Management System

In implementing AI into a complaint management system, we need to prepare a system combination of NLP techniques to understand the classification of customer complaints, including:

* **Language modeling:** Preparation of the system using a pre-trained language model to understand the context and meaning of the complaint
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Aims to determine the emotional tone of the complaint, whether positive or negative.
* **Text Classification:** Serves to find out the categorization of complaints, such as credit cards, debt collection, or the emergence of bugs in the application
* **Natural Language Generation:** Use of NLP to create personalized customer-directed complaint responses and provide solutions where available
* **Data Mining and Machine Learning:** Functions to study previous company historical data and detect recurring problems.
* **Escalation:** If the system cannot resolve the complaint, the system will forward it to the right department.
